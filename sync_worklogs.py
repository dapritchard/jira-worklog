# of the following reasons.
#     (i)  Only the issue name was provided for the working tree, so we need to
#          append the issue key to the dict key.
#     (ii) We already had both the issue name and the key, but now the name has
#          changed on the remote so we need to update the dict key.

# the issue keys to differ.
#
# The issues in `remote` are assumed to be the full set of issues that we care
# about since we grabbed them based on what issues are in `worktree`, and
# furthermore the issue names and keys in the remote are the source of truth so
# we simply need to make the keys for any corresponding issues in `worktree` and
# `head` align with those.
#
# `head` might (i) have issues that aren't in `remote`, and it might also (ii)
# be missing issues that are in remote. Any issues in `head` that are no longer
# in `remote` (and by extension in `worktree` since the set of issues for those
# two objects are assumed to be equal) are no longer needed and are therefore
# removed. If we are missing issues in `head` that are in remote then we add
